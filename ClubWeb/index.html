							<p>Developers are still going nuts for Apple’s new Swift programming language.Since it was introduced last summer, Swift just jumped from number 68 to number 22 in the language rankings from research and analyst firm RedMonk. The rankings seeks to gauge how interested programmers are in different languages.</p><p>That growth is unprecedented in the firm’s rankings, analyst Stephen O’Grady wrote in a blog post about the findings. By comparison, Google’s programming language Go, introduced in 2009, only just broke into the top 20 this quarter. That’s not bad considering the top languages in the rankings are still venerable languages like Java, JavaScript, PHP and C++, but it’s nowhere near as meteoric as Swift’s rise.</p>
